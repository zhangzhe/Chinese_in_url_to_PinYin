If model name is Chinese, using Pinyin in stead in URL. 
Trying railscasts's http://railscasts.com/episodes/63-model-name-in-url. Found it is not good if the model name is Chinese charactor.

So made this plugin to change the Chinese model name into Pinyin, and use it in URL.

How to use:
1.puts Chinese_in_url_to_PinYin into vendor/plugins
2.Use in model
  pinyinlize
  
by default, title will be pinyinlized in URL, it can be changed to name(or other attribute) byï¼š
    pinyinlize :name
or  pinyinlize :other
