If model name is Chinese, use Pinyin in URL. Trying railscasts's http://railscasts.com/episodes/63-model-name-in-url. Found it is not good if the model name is Chinese charactor.

This plugin change the Chinese model name into Pinyin, and use it in URL.

How to use:
1.puts Chinese_in_url_to_PinYin into vendor/plugins
2.Use in model
  pinyinlize
  
by default, title will be pinyinlized in URL, it can be changed to name(or other attribute) byï¼š
    pinyinlize :name
or  pinyinlize :other
